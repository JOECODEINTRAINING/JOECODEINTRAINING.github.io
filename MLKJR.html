1) Martin Luther King Jr. was an American Baptist minister and activist who became the most visible spokesperson and leader in the civil rights movement from 1955 until his assassination in 1968. He is best known for advancing civil rights using nonviolent civil disobedience based on his Christian beliefs.

2) Even after renouncing personal use of guns, King had a complex relationship with self-defense in the movement. He publicly discouraged it as a widespread practice but acknowledged that it was sometimes necessary.[368] Throughout his career King was frequently protected by other civil rights activists who carried arms, such as Colonel Stone Johnson,[369] Robert Hayling, and the Deacons for Defense and Justice.[370][371]

  3) CIA surveillance
CIA files declassified in 2017 revealed that the agency was investigating possible links between King and Communism after a Washington Post article dated November 4, 1964, claimed he was invited to the Soviet Union and that Ralph Abernathy, as spokesman for King, refused to comment on the source of the invitation.[435] Mail belonging to King and other civil rights activists was intercepted by the CIA program HTLINGUAL.[436]
